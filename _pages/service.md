### Important
We are always looking for motivated and talented students. For graduate student positions, it is essential that you meet the department deadline, which is December 15th. You will only then be considered as a potential candidate. Also, contacting me in advance will not likely make any difference, as long as you list me as a potential supervisor. Please see the department website before anything if you intend to apply for graduate school.

### Postdoc
We are currently looking for talented postdocs with backgrounds in the areas of (but not limited to) Neural rendering / Local features and correspondences / Video retrieval. The main role of the postdoc will be to lead an industry-funded research project to publish papers at top Computer Vision and Machine Learning venues.

This position is primarily research-oriented, with strong collaboration opportunities with top researchers in industry, as well as other researchers in the Computer Vision Lab and at UBC CS. UBC CS hosts world-class researchers in the areas relevant to the position including, but not limited to, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Computer Graphics.

Responsibilities:
- Conduct independent research

If interested, please send your CV, names of three references, a research statement (maximum of two pages) to kmyi@cs.ubc.ca.

A successful candidate should have a Ph.D. degree, and a research track record demonstrated by publications at top Computer Vision, Machine Learning, or Graphics conferences (CVPR/ECCV/ICCV/NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR/SIGGRAPH NA/SIGGRAPH Asia).

### Ph.D.
We typically admit **one** Ph.D. student per year. All motivated students are encouraged to apply. Strong mathematical foundation in Linear Algebra is essential, preferably with knowledge on Multiple View Geometry. Having some knowledge on optimization is also a plus. You must have had prior exposure to research/projects relevant to Computer Vision, and we also expect that you have experience with deep learning libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, thus having prior exposure to Deep Learning. Having a publication in relevant domains is also a great plus, but not necessarily required.

### Thesis Masters
Master positions are more focused on short-term projects as they typically last no longer than two years. We expect you to be proficient in Python, and could learn how to use deep learning tools in one term. The following projects are of potential interest (with no guarantee).
